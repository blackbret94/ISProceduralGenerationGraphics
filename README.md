# ISProceduralGenerationGraphics
A repo representing my independent study of procedurally generated graphics.

Several forms of procedural generation will be covered here.  Areas of intended study include landscapes, cities, dungeons, RPG quests, and plotlines.

The first three areas are related to terrain, and will be grouped as such.  The terrain will be coded using Unity3D.  The last two are related to storytelling and will likely be coded in Python.
